## 🏔️ Building on Top of ⚽️ Sports & 🌲 Regional Data

I'm a data analyst & scientist keen on solving complex data problems and transform the insights into actionable data stories within sports economics. Whether it's predictive modeling, advanced analytics, or other business intelligence tasks, I aim to connect the dots first—sometimes with a little help from artificial neurons. ✨

### 🪴 Current Project(s)

#### Škvára | Sports Economics 
[Link](https://newsletter.skvara.org/welcome)
- Škvára [shkva:ra] is a 🇨🇿 🇬🇧 bilingual publication about the economics of sport — how it shapes cities, childhoods, public space and the everyday decisions of athletes, fans, and locals. “Škvára” is the name for old-school gravel sports field in Czech, i.e. place where many stories begin.
- This project blends data analysis, policy evaluation, and observed behaviour — for readers who care about equity, evidence, and sport as more than just results.

🧠 For all who believe sport should belong to everyone.


#### Mini Projects
- Creating **data stories** through full scope data projects to answer questions and solve problems
